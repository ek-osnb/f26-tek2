# GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) Images

## Goal
The goal of this exercise is to pull the Docker image you pushed to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) in the previous exercise and run it locally.

## Step 1: Pull the Docker Image
To pull the Docker image from GHCR, use the following command. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME:latest
```

## Step 2: Create a new docker-compose.ghcr.yml file
In the root of your repository, create a new file named `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`.

Open the `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` file and add the following content:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME:latest
    ports:
      - "8090:8080"
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Step 3: Run the Docker Container
To run the Docker container in detached mode using the `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` file, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
```

> [Note]
> If you get an unauthorized error when trying to pull the image, you may need to authenticate with GHCR.


## Step 4: Verify the Application
To verify that the application is running correctly, you can use the following command to check the health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/actuator/health
```
You should see a response indicating that the application is healthy.

## Step 5: Stop the Docker Container
To stop and remove the Docker container, use the following command:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml down
```

## Step 6: Clean Up
If you want to remove the pulled Docker image from your local machine, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker rmi ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME:latest
```
Make sure to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.


## Troubleshooting

### Unauthorized Error on Pulling Image
If you encounter an unauthorized error when trying to pull the image from GHCR, you need to authenticate with GHCR.

First, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the appropriate scopes. You can do this by going to your GitHub account settings, navigating to "Developer settings" > "Tokens (classic)" ([Link to token page](https://github.com/settings/tokens)), and generating a new token with the `read:packages` scope.

Once you have the token, you can authenticate with GHCR using the following command:

```bash
echo YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
```
> Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you generated, and `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

After authenticating, you should be able to pull the image without any issues.

If you still encounter issues, try authenticating again or check if the token has the correct scopes. You could also try to set the package visibility to public in the repository settings, which would allow anyone to pull the image without authentication.
